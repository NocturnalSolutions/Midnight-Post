# Midnight Post

A Kitura-based Swift blog engine. Not far enough along for practical use yet.

Note that using `swift package generate-xcodeproj` may give you a broken Xcode project file as this tool does not currently seem to work correctly when the directory name has a space in it. Try `swift package generate-xcodeproj --output=MidnightPost.xcodeproj`.
